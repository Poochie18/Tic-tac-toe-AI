<p>This app is intended to be the first time AI is being used.</p>
<p>From a task that implied a textual implementation of tic-tac-toe, it grew into a full-fledged application for a phone with a visual component.</p>
<p><a href="https://clck.ru/TtJAw">Reinforcement learning</a> is used as an algorithm for AI. Since this method is good for a small number of variations of the match outcome. For convenience and understanding of the work, a line of the best states of the AI has been added to the application, as well as its recalculated values after a positive / negative outcome of the match.</p>
<p>Since the game is intended for educational purposes to show how <a href="https://clck.ru/TtJAw">Reinforcement learning</a> works, many points (visual, gameplay and logical) are not taken into account</p>

<p>The main point of the game is to arrange your three signs (X) on the field in one row. You will be confronted by a <strike>genius</strike> dumb AI. Throughout all matches, give the AI ​​a chance to win and learn from its wins and losses.</p> 
<p>So in case of victories in the status bars of his moves for this match there will be an increase. This means that the AI ​​will remember them as high-ranking the next time it is similar.</p>
<p>In case of defeats in the status bars of his moves for this match, there will be a decrease in coefficients. This means the AI ​​will remember them as negative moves on the next similar move.</p>
