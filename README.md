<p>This app is intended to be the first time AI is being used.</p>
<p>From a task that implied a textual implementation of tic-tac-toe, it grew into a full-fledged application for a phone with a visual component.</p>
<p><a href="https://clck.ru/TtJAw">Reinforcement learning</a> is used as an algorithm for AI. Since this method is good for a small number of variations of the match outcome. For convenience and understanding of the work, a line of the best states of the AI has been added to the application, as well as its recalculated values after a positive / negative outcome of the match.</p>
<p>Since the game is intended for educational purposes to show how <a href="https://clck.ru/TtJAw">Reinforcement learning</a> works, many points (visual, gameplay and logical) are not taken into account</p>

<h2>Technologies</h2>
<p>The main AI technology used was <a href="https://clck.ru/TtJAw">Reinforcement learning</a>. The main point of which is to praise the AI ​​for victories and punish for defeats. The implementation of these awards is in the txt file.</p>
